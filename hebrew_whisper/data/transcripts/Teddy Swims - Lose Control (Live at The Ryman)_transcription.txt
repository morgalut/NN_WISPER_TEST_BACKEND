 And the most consistent thing in my life, Desi Hampton on his guitar. This song is called Lose Control. Yeah, I want you to do it too. Something's got a hold on me lately, no I don't know myself anymore. Feels like the walls are all closing in and the devil's knocking at my door. Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you I'm no good at being alone? It's taking a toll on me, trying my best to get from tearing the skin off my bones. Don't you know I lose control when you're not next to me. I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see I lose control when you're not next to me? You're breaking my heart baby, you'll never measure me. Prada Maddy, she Prada means I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit. Bad habits, how to break when I'm with you. Yeah, I know I can do it on my own, what I want back real full. I'm no black magic, then it makes me Prada Maddy, she Prada means when I'm with you I'm a addict. And I need some relief, my stead and your teeth. Can't see the forest through the trees, got feet. Oh, I lose control when you're not next to me. I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see I lose control when you're not next to me? You're breaking my heart baby, you'll never measure me. Prada Maddy Maxwell on the other guitar. Alright, let me hear you guys sing that for everybody. I laude control when you're not next to me. I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see I lose control when you're not next to me? Oh, you're breaking my heart baby, you'll never measure me. Thank you, y'all make some noise for the best man on the planet, Free Prada.
